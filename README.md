# Friendship is Epic

Free and Open-Source, just to show that once it's on the internet you can never get rid of it.

## Where are the assets?
The asset files in total are over 2GB. Because of that, they're both too large to store directly in git and too large to store in github's LFS system, so to get around this
we've had to store the assets files separately outside of the repository ourselves.

You can find the missing files here: https://mega.nz/folder/YCxlRQrS#oG0AbrFDNNLRFjdRVOOv7Q

When checking out the repo, simply create an assets folder and download the contents from that mega link and place them inside.

## Building
